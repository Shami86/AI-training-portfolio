# Use Case — Research Laboratory (Scientific Documents)

## Context
A research laboratory working on algae requested a solution to manage large volumes of data:
- PDFs
- tables
- graphs
- scientific text

---

## Challenges
- Heterogeneous document formats
- Large data volumes
- Complex domain-specific vocabulary

---

## Proposed solution
- Document ingestion (OCR + parsing)
- Text chunking and embedding
- Vector database indexing
- Semantic search over research data
- AI agent for querying and summarization

---

## Technologies involved
- HuggingFace models
- GPU-based inference (NVIDIA)
- Vector databases
- LLMs (Gemini / open-source)
- Agent-based architecture

---

## Value
- Faster access to research insights
- Reduced manual document review
- Knowledge centralized and searchable
