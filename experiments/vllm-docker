# Experiments — vLLM & Local LLM Serving

## Objective
Explore how to serve large language models locally without relying on external APIs.

---

## What is vLLM?
vLLM is a high-performance LLM inference engine designed for:
- low latency
- high throughput
- GPU-based serving

---

## Experiment
- Deployment using Docker Compose
- GPU-based inference (NVIDIA)
- Understanding model serving architecture

---

## Key learnings
- Difference between training and inference
- LLM serving constraints
- Cost and performance considerations
- Alternative to cloud-based APIs

---

## Takeaway
Running LLMs locally is feasible but requires careful infrastructure planning.
