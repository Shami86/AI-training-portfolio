# AI Training Portfolio — Applied AI & Agentic Systems

This repository documents my hands-on training in Artificial Intelligence,
focused on applied AI, agentic systems, semantic search, and real-world use cases.

The training is project-based and covers the full lifecycle:
data → embeddings → vector databases → APIs → AI agents.

## Topics covered
- Semantic search & RAG foundations
- Vector databases (Qdrant)
- FastAPI integration
- AI agents with Google ADK
- MCP concepts
- Real business use cases
- LLM serving (vLLM, Docker)
- GPU-based inference

## Structure
- Day 1: Semantic search & vector databases
- Day 2: AI agents with Google ADK
- Day 3: MCP & advanced agentic systems
- Use cases: research & insurance
